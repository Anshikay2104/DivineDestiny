Ladakh, located in the far north, is most accessible between June and September, when the rest of the country experiences monsoon season. The best time to travel in May to avoid busy traffic times is on weekdays in the middle of the month.The month of May is firmly in the middle of India’s blazing summer. Temperatures in both North and South India are at their peak, so it’s a good month to retreat to the mountains and escape the heat. While there won't be many foreign travelers to compete with, this is summer vacation in India and there's a spike in domestic tourism—you'll want to book your hilltop retreat in advance.</h3>
