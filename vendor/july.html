        <h3 style="text-align: center;">JULY <br><br>Monsoon season is in full swing across India in July. It's the wettest month of the year, especially in Goa and Kerala, with heavy downpours typically lasting for a couple of hours, bringing relief from the heat and humidity of previous months. It brings in a favorable climate for the ripening of fruits up the hills , provides a great fun to children.July cannot be tagged as a summer month nor is it monsoon season. Monsoon would have started to wet the land and the temperature would be moderate. This is the right time for people who want to wander a lot. With monsoon, the plants would be rich and many tourist activities would be at their prime beauty. Travelling will be easier with the pleasant climate in India.</h3>

It is one of the most sacred pilgrimage sites for Hindus and is believed to be first among the twelve jyotirlinga shrines of Shiva.[1] It is unclear when the first version of the Somnath temple was built with estimates varying between the early centuries of the 1st-millennium to about the 9th-century CE.[2][3] The temple is not mentioned in ancient Sanskrit texts of Hinduism as Somnath nomenclature but the "Prabhasa-Pattana" (Prabhas Patan) is mentioned as a tirtha (pilgrimage site), where this temple exists.[4] For example, the Mahabharata in Chapters 109, 118 and 119 of the Book Three (Vana Parva), and Sections 10.45 and 10.78 of the Bhagavata Purana state Prabhasa to be a tirtha on the coastline of Saurashtra.
