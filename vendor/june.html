            <p>The Savitri temple in Pushkar is located on the Ratnagiri hill which is a popular pilgrimage site for the Hindus. The temple is dedicated to Goddess Savitri. It is a very strenuous work to climb on the hilltop but it is believed that the harder you work the more ‘Tapas’ are gained. In this temple you will find the idols of both the wives of Lord Brahma named Savitri and Gayatri. But as per tradition Goddess Savitri is always worshipped first and then prayers to Goddess Gayatri are offered. The visitors can either trek to the temple gates or take a ride in the cable cars which take passengers to the temple. The ropeway ride is really full of fun from where you can have an awesome view of the Pushkar city. However, many devotees prefer to climb 200 stairs leading to the shrine which they consider an important part of their pilgrimage to the place.</p>
