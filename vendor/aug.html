        <h1>28' August -- Onam </h1>
        <h2>The festival of Onam is celebrated throughout the state of Kerala. Kerala during Onam is marked by happiness, excitement and enjoyment among all sections of people. Onam is celebrated as an outcome of reasons that have to do with mythology as well as old agrarian practices. If one is to go by the myth, then King Mahabali or Maveli was a generous and virtuous ruler, who had once ruled Kerala. During his rule, the kingdom became so prosperous that devas (gods of the Heaven) felt jealous about this and also for the reason that King Mahabali was an asura - a member of the demon clan - who were the enemies of devas. So, they sent Lord Vishnu in the guise of Vamana (a dwarf) to King Mahabali. As an offering from the generous king, Vamanarequested Mahabali for three feet of land. And at the time of measuring the three feet of land,Vamana grew so huge that he measured all the worlds in two steps. Since he had nowhere else to place his third step, Mahabali asked Vamana to place it on his head. Pleased by his benevolence, Vamana blessed Mahabali before he was sent to the nether world and granted him permission to visit his dear subjects once in a year. This occasion is celebrated by all Keralites as Onam.</h2></div>

        <h1>15' August -- Aadi Amavasya</h1>
        <h2>The month of Aadi is considered highly auspicious when divine forces bless the earth with grace and answer your prayers. Offering Tarpanam rituals for your ancestors on Aadi Amavasya can help their souls attain Moksha (salvation), and they in turn bestow their blessings on you.On Amavasya (New Moon) day, the Sun and the Moon occupy the same sign. The Sun signifies the father and soul; whereas the Moon signifies the mother and mind. Aadi Amavasya is of great importance because the Sun and the Moon occupy Cancer, the sign of Moon.It is believed that on Aadi Amavasya, spirits are more willing to accept the offerings and are satisfied when their successors perform Tarpanam rituals for them. In addition, every year, during the month of Aadi, the Sun starts its movement towards the South, which is called ‘Dakshinayana’ (Dakshin means south, and Ayana means travel). Since this is the first New Moon day during this period, it is regarded as the more powerful day for performing Tarpanam rituals.</h2>

Depending on their personal affordability, people gifted cows, clothing, food etc.The devotees then prayed at the Sri Ramanathaswamy temple overlooking the sea front and also soaked themselves with the water taken from the 22 'sacred wells' in the temple complex on the occasion.'Mahaalya Amavaasya' is considered particularly important as, according to Chandra Iyer, priest in the Rameswaram temple, legend has it that on this occasion, all departed souls across 21 generations take "special permission from Lord Yama (the God of Death) to visit earth in the form of 'Pitrus' and bless their surviving offspring on this earth this day every year.
